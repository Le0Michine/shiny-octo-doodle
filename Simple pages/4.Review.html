        <h2>Introduction from the book</h2>
        <p><q>The Microsoft .NET Framework introduces many concepts, technologies, and terms. My goal in this chapter is to give you an overview of how the .NET Framework is designed, introduce you to some of the technologies the framework includes, and define many of the terms you’ll be seeing when you start using it. I’ll also take you through the process of building your source code into an application or a set of redistributable components (files) that contain types (classes, structures, etc.) and then explain how your application will execute.
            </q>

        <h2>Short review</h2>
        <p>
            This book describes in details basics of C# programming, gives general knowledge about <abbr title="Common Language Runtime">CLR</abbr>. Jeffrey Richter describes a lot of aspects of C# programming very clear he gives some comparisons with other programming languages such as Java, Visual Basic etc. In the book also desctibed how C# code is being compiled into <abbr title="Intermediate Language">IL</abbr> instructions, you can find examples of such code and look under the hood of CLR. Book covers almost everithing you need to start programming using C# and .NET: Assamlies, Types, Events, Delegates, Containers, Threading and TPL, Application domains and much more.
